    "- How does Scale-Out occur in MongoDB?\n",
    "- What are some features of MongoDB?\n",
    "    - **Indexing:** It supports generic secondary indexes and provides unique, compound, geospatial, and full-text indexing capabilities as well.\n",
    "    - **Aggregation:** It provides an aggregation framework based on the concept of data processing pipelines.\n",
    "    - **Special collection and index types:** It supports time-to-live (TTL) collections for data that should expire at a certain time\n",
    "    - **File storage:** It supports an easy-to-use protocol for storing large files and file metadata.\n",
    "    - **Sharding:** Sharding is the process of splitting data up across machines.\n",
    "- How to add data in MongoDB?\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    insertOne\n",
    "    db.books.insertOne({\"title\" : \"Start With Why\"})\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- How do you Update a Document?\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    updateOne\n",
    "    updateMany\n",
    "    replaceOne\n",
    "    \n",
    "    {\n",
    "       \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"4b2b9f67a1f631733d917a7a\"),\n",
    "       \"name\" : \"alice\",\n",
    "       \"friends\" : 24,\n",
    "       \"enemies\" : 2\n",
    "   }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- How do you delete a document?\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    db.books.deleteOne({\"_id\" : 3})\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- How to perform queries in MongoDB?\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    db.users.find({\"age\" : 24})\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- What are the data types in MongoDB?\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB supports a wide range of data types as values in documents. Documents in MongoDB are similar to objects in JavaScript. Along with JSON’s essential key/value–pair nature, MongoDB adds support for a number of additional data types. The common data types in MongoDB are:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Null\n",
    "    {\"x\" : null}\n",
    "    Boolean\n",
    "    {\"x\" : true}\n",
    "    Number\n",
    "    {\"x\" : 4}\n",
    "    String\n",
    "    {\"x\" : \"foobar\"}\n",
    "    Date\n",
    "    {\"x\" : new Date()}\n",
    "    Regular expression\n",
    "    {\"x\" : /foobar/i}\n",
    "    Array\n",
    "    {\"x\" : [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]}\n",
    "    Embedded document\n",
    "    {\"x\" : {\"foo\" : \"bar\"}}\n",
    "    Object ID\n",
    "    {\"x\" : ObjectId()}\n",
    "    Binary Data\n",
    "    Binary data is a string of arbitrary bytes.\n",
    "    Code\n",
    "    {\"x\" : function() { /* ... */ }}\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **When to use MongoDB?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    You should use MongoDB when you are building internet and business applications that need to evolve quickly and scale elegantly. MongoDB is popular with developers of all kinds who are building scalable applications using agile methodologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **MongoDB is a great choice if one needs to:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Support a rapid iterative development.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Scale to high levels of read and write traffic - MongoDB supports horizontal scaling through Sharding, distributing data across several machines, and facilitating high throughput operations with large sets of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Scale your data repository to a massive size.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Evolve the type of deployment as the business changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Store, manage and search data with text, geospatial, or time-series dimensions."
